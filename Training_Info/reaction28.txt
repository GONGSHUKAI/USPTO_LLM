Reaction 20010911-US06288082B1-0114 description:
A mixture of 0.50 g (1 equivalent) of 7-(2-chloro-ethoxy)-4-chloro-6-methoxy-quinoline-3-carbonitrile, 0.25 g (1.1 equivalents) of 6-aminoindazole, 0.22 g (1.1 equivalents) of pyridine hydrochloride and 15 ml of 2-methoxyethanol was heated in 120째 C. oil bath for 2 hours. The reaction progress was monitored by thin layer chromatography (acetone/hexane 1:1). After 2 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature; a total of 25 ml of 1M sodium bicarbonate was added and the reaction was stirred for 1 hour. The resultant precipitate was collected, washed with water and dried in vacuo at 60째 C. overnight to give 0.645 g (97%) of the desired product. :mass spectrum (electrospray m/e): M+H=393.9 (M+H)+; Analysis calculated for C20H16ClN5O2: 2 H2O: Calculated C:55.88; H:4.69; N:16.29; Found C:55.63; H:4.78; N:15.24

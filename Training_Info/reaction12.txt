Reaction 20130409-US08415362B2-0820 description:
To a solution of 3-[4-(7-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]pentanal (prepared as in Example 498, step 1; 300 mg, 0.0008 mol) in DCM (4 mL, 0.06 mol) cooled at 0° C., triphenylphosphine (800 mg, 0.003 mol) and carbon tetrabromide (500 mg, 0.002 mol) were added. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 10 min, water was added and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed with saturated sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by prep LC-MS (ACN, water, NH4OH) to give 4-[1-(4,4-dibromo-1-ethylbut-3-en-1-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-7-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine as an amorphous solid (50 mg, 10%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ, 8.9 (s, 2H), 8.4 (s, 1H), 8.3 (s, 1H), 7.4 (m, 1H), 7.3 (s, 1H), 6.9 (m, 1H), 6.4 (m, 1H), 5.7 (s, 2H), 4.2 (m, 1H), 3.6 (m, 2H), 2.8 (m, 2H), 2.1 (m, 1H), 2.0 (m, 1H), 1.0 (m, 5H), LC/MS (M+H)+: m/z=556

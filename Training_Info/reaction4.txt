Reaction 20160519-US20160137613A1-0847 description:
To a solution of ethyl 4-(4-(methylsulfonyloxy)piperidin-1-yl)benzoate (10.5 g, 32.1 mmol) in DMF (50 mL) was added sodium azide (4.17 g, 64.2 mmol). The mixture was heated at 80° C. for 5 hours, cooled to room temperature, diluted with brine (300 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (400 mL). The organic phase was washed with brine (2×300 mL), dried over anyhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated, to afford ethyl 4-(4-azidopiperidin-1-yl)benzoate as a yellow solid (7.62 g, 87%).

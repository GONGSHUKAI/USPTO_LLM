Reaction 20060216-US20060035938A1-1159 description:
4(Bromomethyl)-2-methoxy-1-(methylsulfonyl)benzene (62 mg, 0.22 mmol) in methanol was slowly added to an equal mixture of ammonia (28%) and methanol. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and evaporated. The reaction mixture was partitioned was between EtOAc and aqueous 6M sulphuric acid The aqueous phase was made alkaline with sodium hydroxide and extracted with CH2Cl2; The CH2Cl2 phase was dried and evaporated to afford the title compound (36 mg, 76%).

Reaction 20090528-US20090137822A1-0041 description:
In a flask having an inner volume of 25 ml and equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a reflux condenser were charged 10 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, 1.16 g (10.0 mmol) of methyl 3-methoxyacrylate and 0.91 g of 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol (12 mmol as α-mercaptoacetaldehyde), then, 0.38 g (2 mmol) of titanium tetrachloride was gradually added dropwise thereto while maintaining the liquid temperature to 20° C., and the mixture was reacted under stirring at 67° C. for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Eluent; n-hexane/ethyl acetate=5/1 to 1/1 (volume ratio)) to obtain 0.62 g (Isolation yield; 44%) of 3-methoxycarbonylthiophene as colorless powder.

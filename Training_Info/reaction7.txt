Reaction 20091210-US20090306133A1-1276 description:
DIPEA (42 μL, 0.24 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and methyl chloroformate (23 mg, 0.24 mmol, 2.0 eq.) were added to a solution of tert-butyl [(trans-4-{[({2-[3-(aminomethyl)phenyl] quinolin-4-yl}carbonyl)amino]methyl}cyclohexyl)methyl]carbamate (Example 39) (60 mg, 0.12 mmol) in DCM (1 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at rt and then diluted with water and MeOH and a mixture of DCM and MeOH were added. The layers were separated and the organic phase was concentrated in vacuo to leave a residue. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography using increasingly polar mixtures of DCM and EtOAc as eluent to give the title compound (59 mg, 88%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.18-8.07 (m, 2H), 8.00 (s, 1H), 7.95 (d, 1H), 7.78 (s, 1H), 7.72 (t, 1H), 7.52 (t, 1H), 7.43 (t, 1H), 7.39-7.33 (m, 1H), 6.54 (s, 1H), 5.32 (s, 1H), 4.64 (s, 1H), 4.45-4.37 (m, 2H), 3.68 (s, 3H), 3.36 (t, 2H), 2.94 (t, 2H), 1.89-1.72 (m, 4H), 1.63-1.49 (m, 1H), 1.42 (s, 10H), 1.09-0.83 (m, 4H); m/z 561.2 (M+H)+.

Reaction 19980602-US05760259-0009 description:
Sodium (0.22 g, 9.6 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (20 mL). Diethyl malonate (1.53 g, 9.6 mmol) in EtOH (5 mL) and 7-phenoxyheptyl bromide (2.36 g, 8.7 mmol) in EtOH (5 mL) were subsequently added at room temperature. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 8 h. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was taken up in ethyl acetate (150 mL). The organic phase was washed with water (2×50 mL), and brine (50 mL), and dried over Na2SO4. The crude product was purified by Kugelrohr distillation to give ethyl 2-ethoxycarbonyl-9-phenoxynonanoate (1.92 g, 63%), bp 150°-154° C./0.1 torr, 1H-NMR: 1.24 (t, 6H), 1.1-1.8 (m, 12H), 3.30 (t, 1H), 3.91 (t, 2H), 4.18 (q, 4H), 6.7-7.2 (m, 5H).

Reaction 20160204-US20160031874A1-0204 description:
Specifically, a mixture of N-(3 -methylpyridin-2-yl)-4-(pyridin-2-yl)thiazol-2-amine 1 (54 mg, 0.20 mmol) and N-chlorosuccinimide (32 mg, 0.24 mmol) in dichloromethane (2 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 64 h. After diluted with dichloromethane, the mixture was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on a silica gel gel (ethyl acetate:chloroform=1:4-1:2) to give compound 16 (57 mg, 93% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) Î´10.86 (s, 1H), 8.70-8.65 (m, 1H), 8.23-8.18 (m, 1H), 8.01 (d, J=7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.92 (t, J=7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.60 (d, J=6.7 Hz, 1H), 7.41-7.35 (m, 1H), 6.99-6.93 (m, 1H), 2.36 (s, 3H). Rt 1.34 min, MS+303.0/304.9.

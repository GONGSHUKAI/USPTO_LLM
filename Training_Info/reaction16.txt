Reaction 20150716-US20150197530A1-0155 description:
0.095 g (0.270 mmol) of 2-(5-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-2-phenylthiophen-3-yl)acetic acid were solubilized in 3 ml of dichloromethane, to this solution were added with magnetic stirring, 0.047 ml (0.540 mmol) of oxalyl chloride and a drop of dimethylformamide. The mixture was stirred at r.t. for 2 h before being concentrated in vacuo. This product was solubilized in 2 ml of tetrahydrofurane so as to be next added dropwise with magnetic stirring to a solution of 0.049 ml (0.593 mmol) of pyrrolidine in 2 ml of tetrahydrofurane. The mixture was stirred at r.t. for 16 h. The reaction medium was poured into 20 ml of water, the aqueous phase was extracted with 2×10 ml of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried on Na2SO4 which was then removed by filtration and the obtained filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash chromatography on a silica gel cartridge (eluent: dichloromethane/ethyl acetate, 3/1, v/v). 0.077 g (yield=65%) of 2-(5-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-2-phenylthiophen-3-yl)-1-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethanone were obtained as a pale brown oil. LC-MS: m/z=406 (MH+), UV purity at 254 nm=93%. 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO) δ 7.87 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.64 (s, 1H), 7.57-7.42 (m, 5H), 7.13 (d, J=8.9 Hz, 2H), 3.87 (s, 3H), 3.68 (s, 2H), 3.46-3.23 (m, 4H), 1.91-1.68 (m, 4H).

[Input]
Reaction 20001114-US06147097-0041 description:
To 1.9 ml of thionyl chloride was added 370 mg (1.4 mmol) of [1,2-dimethyl-5-(3,5-dimethylphenylthio)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]methanol (42b), and the mixture was heated at 70° C. for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Ice-water and then a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution were added to the reaction mixture to neutralize, and extracted with diethyl ether. The organic layer was washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate) to give 288 mg of 4-chloromethyl-1,2-dimethyl-5-(3,5-dimethylphenylthio)imidazole (42c) as oil (yield 73%).

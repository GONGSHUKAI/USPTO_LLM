Reaction 20140918-US20140275241A1-0166 description:
Dimethyl carbonate (2.7 g, 30 mmol) was added to a suspension of sodium hydride (1.8 g, 60% in mineral oil, 45 mmol) in THF (50 mL) at room temperature. The mixture was refluxed for 30 min. Compound 1 (4.2 g, 15.7 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added by syringe. The reaction was refluxed for 14 h and cooled to room temperature. Acetic acid was slowly added to the mixture until pH 4-5 and water (50 mL) was added. The product was extracted into EtOAc (100 mL×3) and the combined extracts were dried. The solution was filtered and solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel eluted with 5% EtOAc in hexanes) to afford compound 2 (3.6 g, 68%): [α]D25 −63.6 (c 0.42, CHCl3); 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 12.10 (s, 1H), 3.71 (s, 3H), 3.39 (t, J=8.2 Hz, 1H), 1.11 (s, 9H), 0.72 (s, 3H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 172.8, 171.6, 96.9, 80.6, 72.1, 51.3, 49.9, 42.9, 38.3, 36.9, 36.6, 36.1, 31.0, 28.7, 28.6, 28.5, 27.7, 23.5, 11.5. Anal. Calcd for (C20H32O4): C, 71.39; H, 9.59. Found: C, 71.50, H, 9.61.

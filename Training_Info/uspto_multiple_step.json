When the evolution of hydrogen has ceased, benzyl chloride (9.54 g, 75.4 mmol) is added in three portions over a period of 10 minutes. The mixture warms to 60\u00b0 C., and after stirring for one hour a suspension forms. On the rotavapor, a part of the DMF (about 80 mL) is removed, which leads to crystallization of the product. Water (300 mL) is added, and the crystallized product is triturated at 80\u00b0 C. for one hour on the rotavapor. The product is filtered off, washed twice with water (200 mL each washing), and dried to give 26.8 g (85%) of the title compound as pale yellow crystals, mp=167-168\u00b0 C.

We call this format \\u201cHeterogeneous Graph\\u201d. The notations of entities are as follows:\\n(1) Reactants include 'Rx' and 'Mx'. 'Rx' represents reactants, 'Mx' represents the mixture 'x' with uncertain substances. \\n(2) Reaction conditions include 'Sx', 'Cx', 'Ex', and 'Tx'. \\n(3) Products include symbols 'Mx' and 'Px'. \\n\\nThe numbers after entities show their position(indices) in the reaction description, which only helps to identify the entities in the reaction description.\\n\\nAlso, you need to stick to 5 rules:\\n(1) In each substep, there are at most two \\\">\\\", separating reactants, reaction conditions, and products!

Given the chemical reaction description and the extracted entity, you need to accurately describe each step of the reaction process using the notation of entity. \\n\\nThe chemical reactions have multiple steps. Do not use one line to describe the reaction. Change the line for each substep. Each substep is represented as '[reactants] > [reaction conditions] > [products]'. We call this format \\u201cHeterogeneous Graph\\u201d. The notations of entities are as follows:\\n(1) Reactants include 'Rx' and 'Mx'. 'Rx' represents reactants, 'Mx' represents the mixture 'x' with uncertain substances. \\n(2) Reaction conditions include 'Sx', 'Cx', 'Ex', and 'Tx'. \\n(3) Products include symbols 'Mx' and 'Px'. \\n\\nThe numbers after entities show their position(indices) in the reaction description, which only helps to identify the entities in the reaction description.\\n\\nAlso, you need to stick to 5 rules:\\n(1) In each substep, there are at most two \\\">\\\", separating reactants, reaction conditions, and products!

You CANNOT reuse the reaction conditions and reactants in different substeps!\\n\\n(4) The entities of reactants, reactant conditions (solvent, catalyst, time, temperature), and products are already listed after the total chemical reaction description. You need to extract the logic of chemical reactants to generate the Heterogeneous Graph correctly.

Reaction 20120112-US20120010315A1-0067 description:
2-Naphthyl glycidyl ether (1.0 g, 5.0 mmol), as a starting material, was stirred with tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.081 g, 0.25 mmol) and 2-naphthol (0.441 g, 3 mmol). Then, reaction was carried out at 110° C. for 2 hours and 30 minutes in a toluene solvent (20 mL) under reflux. The resulting crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Rf=0.2, hexane:ethyl acetate=5:1, v/v). 1,3-Bis(2-naphthoxy)-2-propanol (0.7579 g, 88%) was yielded.

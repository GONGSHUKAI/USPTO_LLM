Reaction 20100112-US07645771B2-0192 description:
To 3.9 g (16.9 mmol) 8-benzyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one oxime was added 3.5 g of sodium in 200 ml of pentanol by portion over 1 hr. The mixture was refluxed for 3 hrs and cooled to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted with 6 N HCl. The aqueous layer was basified using NaOH pellets and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed to afford 2.9 g (80%) of crude product as a brown oil.

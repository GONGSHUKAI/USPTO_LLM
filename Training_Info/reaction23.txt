Reaction 20120329-US20120077801A1-0376 description:
2-Chloro-5-fluoronicotinic acid (3.65 g, 21 mmol), potassium carbonate (3.6 g, 26 mmol), 3-benzylaniline (5.4 g, 30 mmol), copper(I) bromide (155 mg, 1.2 mmol) and copper (80 mg, 1.3 mmol) were weighed into a round bottomed flask and N-methylpyrrolidinone (15 mL) was added. After degassing the mixture it was heated under nitrogen at 150° C. for 2 h. The black reaction mixture was poured onto water and the mixture was stirred overnight. The obtained solid was filtered, washed with water and dried in air to yield the sub-title compound as a pale brown solid (1.3 g, 18%) which was used without further purification in the subsequent step.

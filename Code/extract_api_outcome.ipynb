The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for 16 hrs. The reaction mixture was neutralised with saturated NaHCO3 and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), the mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to give the crude product which was purified by preparative TLC (eluent 10% MeOH in DCM). Further purification, by automated reverse phase HPLC (low pH method), gave the title compound as an off-white solid (40 mg, 28%).\\n\\nREACTANTs:\\nR1: N-(5-chloro-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-5-phenylpyridine-3-sulfonamide,25;\\nR2: NaHCO3,305;\\nR3: BBr3,146;\\n\\n\\nPRODUCTs:\\nP1: title compound,610;\\n\\n\\nSOLVENTs:\\nS1: DCM,114;\\nS2: DCM,524;\\n\\n\\nCATALYSTs:\\nNone\\n\\nTIMEs:\\nT1: 16 hrs,245;\\n\\n\\nTEMPERATUREs:\\nE1: −10° C.,128;\\nE2: room temperature,208;\\n\\n\\nYIELD:\\nY1: 28%,655;\\n\\n[Output]:\\nDon't make the mistake of 'R1.R3.S1.E1.T1>M1\\nM1.R2>P1' .Check the 5 rules again!\\n\",\n",

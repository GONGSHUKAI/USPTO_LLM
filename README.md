# USPTO-LLM

## Introduction about USPTO-LLM

USPTO-LLM is a information-enriched chemical reaction dataset. We employ **large language models** to extract chemical reactions and reaction conditions from the patent documents of USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office). The chemical reactions are organized as heterogeneous directed graphs, such as 
- NC1(CCCC1)C(=O)O.S(=O)(Cl)Cl.CO>>Cl.NC1(CCCC1)C(=O)OC

Compared with the existing chemical reaction datasets such as USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT and USPTO-full, USPTO-LLM encompasses detailed reaction conditions, such as
- solvents: ['C(Cl)Cl']

- catalysts: ['CN(C)C=1C=CN=CC1']

- temperature: ['room temperature']

- time: ['25200']

## About this repository
This repository contains the code for generating the USPTO-LLM dataset.

### Code 
In 'USPTO-LLM/Code', there are several python files and jupyter notebooks.

1. `api_request_parallel_processor.py` is used to call the API to generate the heterogeneous directed graph of USPTO-LLM. Our default API is gpt-4-1106-preview.

2. `generate_request.py` is used to generate the json file `uspto_request.json` for each API submission based on the reaction data in `uspto_full.json` and the `FIXED_PROMPT`.

3. `extract_api_outcome.ipynb` is used to extract the reaction data from the `result_uspto_request.json` generated by the API, including the "pattern repair" technique mentioned in the paper.

4. `prompt_to_json.py` is used to convert the written prompt into json format and store it in the string variable `FIXED_PROMPT`.

The running order is: `prompt_to_json.py` → `generate_request.py` → `api_request_parallel_processor.py` → `extract_api_outcome.ipynb`

### Prompt

Prompt is used to guide the large language model to generate the standardized heterogeneous directed graph of USPTO-LLM. The prompt is stored in the `Prompt` folder, including the `.txt` and `.json` versions of the prompt.

##### Training_Info

The following table shows the performance of different large language models used in this work to generate heterogeneous directed graphs in the USPTO-LLM dataset.

We call this format \\u201cHeterogeneous Graph\\u201d. The notations of entities are as follows:\\n(1) Reactants include 'Rx' and 'Mx'. 'Rx' represents reactants, 'Mx' represents the mixture 'x' with uncertain substances. \\n(2) Reaction conditions include 'Sx', 'Cx', 'Ex', and 'Tx'. \\n(3) Products include symbols 'Mx' and 'Px'. \\n\\nThe numbers after entities show their position(indices) in the reaction description, which only helps to identify the entities in the reaction description.\\n\\nAlso, you need to stick to 5 rules:\\n(1) In each substep, there are at most two \\\">\\\", separating reactants, reaction conditions, and products!
